Warning: Breaks bootstrapping again!

- trs804p: implement fully native drivers and bootloader!
- Make BLK into a separate subsystem and remove indirection
  layer in BLK@* and BLK!*. See doc/blk.txt.
- Remove "0b" literals.
- Change "0x" literal prefix to the more traditional (and simple to parse) "$".
- Rename (parse) to PARSE.
- VE: change cmd prefix from $ to % to avoid clashing with literals.
- z80: simplify and optimize FIND implementation.
- Make dict previous entry offsets absolute instead of relative.
- Move HERE and CURRENT initialization, which was previously arch-specific code
  to arch-independant Forth code.
- Remove EMPTY and make BOOT user-callable.
- Add word "MEM>BLK" in B121.
- Add word "context" in B122. See doc/usage.txt.
- xcomp: improve error handling and documentation (doc/cross.txt).
- VE: Replace many AT-XY calls with CELL!, making screen refreshes faster and
  less noisy.
- grid: Change NEWLN signature, giving more flexibility to video drivers in
  handling the event. See doc/grid.txt.
- grid: Add CELLS! optional word, which can greatly speed up screen refreshes.
- Remove RCS metadata which doesn't have much advantage over comparing tarball
  snapshots.
- ed+VE: Make IBUF and FBUF into counted strings, making their manipulation more
  straightforward.
- Redefine "empty char cell" as $20 rather than $00. Affects WIPE and IBUF/FBUF.
- VE: display all characters as-is rather than spitting chars lower than $20 as
  $20. Previously, $00 chars all over the place would make the screen
  unreadable, but now it works.
- blkpack: fill with $20 instead of zeroes.
- VE: Stop using RDLN for input. It wasn't working well with IBUF/FBUF as
  counted strings.
- Remove KEY> putback buffer which isn't needed anymore. With hindsight,
  piggybacking on RDLN from VE wasn't such a clever idea after all. It
  introduced significant "side-complexity".
- emul: remove TRS-80 4P emulator. It wasn't emulating at the proper level any
  more and I didn't want to write another.

Warning: this breaks bootstrapping. If you have a machine that is self-
bootstrapping, you won't be able to do so from the previous snapshot. For this
update, you'll have to upload your binary from a POSIX environment.

- Change word type numbering scheme. It's now simpler to decode.
  See doc/impl.txt
- Rename CONSTANT to VALUE, *! to VAL!, **! to *VAL!, CONSTS to VALUES.
- Rename :* to ALIAS, :** to *ALIAS.
- Add *VALUE, TO, *TO, [TO] and [*TO]. See doc/usage.txt
- Make CURRENT, HERE, IN(, IN> and BLK> into *VALUE.
- Add KEY> and NL values to avoid SYSVARS offset hardcoding.
- Make SYSVARS more compact.
- Remove unused +!, EOT? and RAM+.
- Simplify VE.
- asm: make ORG and BIN( into VALUEs.
- cvm: make code follow C89 rather than C99, remove usage of stdbool and stdint.
- Re-add 'S and S0, add 'R, R0 and .S
- Remove overflow checks. See doc/impl.txt for rationale.
- Simplify EOT handling in WORD and document EOT quirk in initialization
  sequence better. See doc/impl.txt
- Move AVR firmware from doc/hw/z80/sms/code/smsps2ctl.fs to the blkfs. Firmware
  for microcontrollers of supported hardware should be part of the OS itself.
- Remove |L and rename |M to L|M.
- Add the "Useful little words" section at B120, starting with nC,.
- trs804p: add support for double-density disks.
- Replace initialization string with initialization wordref in stable ABI.

*** 2021-05-15

- Add native >>, <<, >>8, <<8 words.
- Make |L, |M, RSHIFT and LSHIFT into regular Forth words.
- Rename (entry) to ENTRY.
- Add PAD and have it replace WORDBUF in SYSVARS.
- The 6809 emulator is now usable.
- Little optimizations sprinkled around.
- xcomp: remove a little cruft.
- Stop using null char termination as buffer bound in RDLN. We now use the whole
  buffer for typed contents.
- Make LOAD line-based.
- Add line comments with "\".
- Make BLK buffer allocated at compile time.
- Add CONSTS word.
- Re-add tests in extras. This time, they can conveniently be ran from a
  "native" Collapse OS machine (rather than needing POSIX), which makes them
  more interesting.
- Tidy up 8086 code and improve docs.
- Improve asm docs.
- z80 asm: remove IX- and IY-.
- Remove CARRY? support for *. Unused yet and too complex to implement on 6809.
- 8086: implement CARRY?.
- 6809: implement CARRY?.
- Add RANGE and SRANGE, making loops over memory simpler.
- Simplify literal parsing.

*** 2021-04-21

- cvm: rename "forth" to "cos-grid" and add new "cos-serial" binary.
- z80 asm: add CALLc op.
- z80 asm: Add LDHL(HL), and LDBC(HL), macros.
- z80: use DE instead of BC to store IP. This opens the door to interesting
       optimizations. I took inspiration from Brad Rodriguez's CamelForth for
       this. I'm not planning, however, on having an in-register TOS like Brad
       does. It looks real neat, but Brad doesn't check for overflow/underflow
       like I do and I'm thinking I'd mess things up with this kind of scheme.
- z80: optimize next, exec, (br), (n), EXIT, LSHIFT, RSHIFT for speed.
- z80: minimize overflow checks through counter system.
- z80: IY register, which was previously unused, is now reserved for pointing to
       SYSVARS.
- Make 2DUP, 2DROP, > into regular Forth words. Not worth keeping as native.
- Add CARRY? mechanism. See usage.txt. Not done for 8086 and 6809 yet.
- In folder extras/, there's a WIP 6809 emulator written in Forth for Collapse
  OS. This should make Collapse OS a much cozier development environment.

*** 2021-04-03

- xcomp: add XWRAP".
- asm: remove BREAK,. Too complex and hackish for what it's worth.
- Remove barely used word IMMED?
- 8086 asm: add CMPri, CMPxi, and CMPxI,
- 8086: inline chkPS, code and make more compact.
- z80: make chkPS, parametrizable and inlined.
- z80: optimize lblexec for speed
- 6809 asm: fix broken [] addressing mode.
- trs804p: fix broken emulator.
- cvm: make oflw/uflw checks behave like other ports. It previously cheated,
  making CVM behavior slightly different.
- Check for overflow less often. Previously, we would check at every "next"
  call. Now, we check upon entering a compiled word and at the end of any
  native word with a "positive" PS balance.
- Fix PC/AT MBR for some machines. (Jakob Krisch)
- VE: refactor a little bit.

*** 2021-03-20

- Complete the 6809/CoCo2 port!
  - Handle SHIFT in (key?)
  - Implement the Grid protocol
  - Implement stack overflow/underflow detection
  - Implement QUIT and ABORT
  - Add doc/hw/6809/coco2.txt
  - This makes Collapse OS run properly on the CoCo2. No BLK yet, but otherwise
    fully functional. Keyboard debouncing is still a bit shaky, but it doesn't
    make the system unusable.
- Big blkfs reshuffling. The idea was to make stuff that belong together con-
  tiguous. Also, I brought back arch-specific device drivers into the main
  blkfs space. When I created the arch overlay system, I hadn't yet started
  offloading docs and code comments to the doc/ folder. Now that it's done,
  arch-specific code isn't as heavy as it used to be, so putting everything
  under the same blkfs makes sense again. See doc/usage.txt
- Remove PICK: Too complex for what it's worth.
- Remove 'S and S0: When I began, I thought I'd play with PS a lot through
  those, but it turns out I never needed them.
- trs80-4p: Allow BREAKing out of I/O induced infinite loops.
- 6809 asm: detect 8-bit branching overflow.

*** 2021-03-03

- 6809 port: we have prompt! a barely usable one, but still feels good!
- Fix bugs in 6809 assembler
- Implement (imperfectly) the XMODEM protocol in the Remote Shell app.
- tools: make blkup slightly faster.
- xcomp: re-add X' which I though wasn't used, but was.
- Remove automated testing. Most of the problems popping up in Collapse OS
  development are hardware-related. Moreover, now that I use Collapse OS
  to develop Collapse OS, "userland" is pretty well tested that way. This
  removal allows me to remove tooling that is annoying to keep around.
- Fix endian issues in core words.
- Remove unused WIPED? from core.
- cvm: make WCOLS/WLINES adjustments easier. only one place to adjust now.
- cvm: simplify the staging program.
- doc: add code subsection.
- Remove unused >< and >=0 and simplify =><=.
- Make z80 boot code more compact

*** 2021-02-19

- Make good progress on 6809 port!
- Add W"" literal, allowing to "compile" WORD-using words. For example,
  ": foo W" hello" CREATE ;" becomes possible.
- Remove "~C!" mechanism. It was unnecessary and slow. Made the AT28 driver,
  the reason for this system, use simple C! and ! overrides.
- Remove 0, 1 and -1 native words and replace them with (b). It makes porting
  simpler and makes binaries slightly slimmer overall.
- Make S0 into a Forth word.
- Add []= and make S= into a Forth word.
- Remove CMP and make =, < and > native.
- Improve 6809 assembler.
- Make xcomp tools endian-aware.
- Replace native _find with FIND. We don't need to find words in alternate dicts
  anymore now that we have XFIND.
- DOES>: swap PFA and jump address so that more than 2b can be attached it.
  As a bonus, fix DOES> on 8086. It was simply broken.
- Improve documentation, especially impl.txt which had a lot of out-of-date
  and incomplete information.

*** 2021-02-11

- Add 6809 port WIP! Well, more of a placeholder... or a sneeze, really.
  But it's a first step, and it actually runs on actual hardware and was
  developed and deployed from Collapse OS itself.
- Rename HERE to H and H@ to HERE. I had it all wrong...
- Make QUIT and ABORT into native words.
- Remove ROLL which wasn't used anywhere.
- Add |T T! and T, words to assemblers. See "Endian-ness" in doc/cross.txt.
- Add "QUIT jump" to stable ABI.
- Fix endian-ness bugs in 6809 assembler
- Add "LIVETGT" helper to assemblers. See "Live Targets" in doc/asm/intro.txt.
- Improve Remote Shell reliability. It's now reliable enough for "rupload" to
  be used for real stuff (for example, writing 6809 binaries to EEPROM!)
- tools: make blkunpack right-trim whitespaces.
- trs80-4p can now use both floppy drives.
- trs80-4p add WIP "native" keyboard driver in effort to remove dependency on
  TRS-DOS.
- trs80-4p: improve RS-232 driver.
- Place Z80 drivers together in their own little zone in blkfs.
- Make font compilers more compact and fix a few glitches.

*** 2021-01-25

- Make Z80 and 8086 assemblers more compact
- Add 6809 assembler
- Create a new "asm" folder in doc, making it clearer.
- Add KEY> core word
- Fix PS leak in DUMP
- Improve VE

*** 2021-01-19

- Remove "breathing" in tools/. Now that we have proper RTS/CTS in place,
  this mechanism is spurious.
- Improve VE.
- Remove C<? word.
- Improve LOAD.
- Remove CURRENT*.
- Improve Remote Shell and add "rupload".
- Allow using aliases in xcomp.
- Improve ACIA drivers in trs80 and rc2014.
- Add "constant" word type, making CONSTANT much faster and usable in cross-
  compilation.
- Make Block Editor and Visual Editor a bit more compact in blkfs.

*** 2021-01-05

- Initial RCS-based release
- Remove all git-related files
- Transform .md files into plain text
- Add "make clean" command in every Makefile
- Add top-level "make clean" and "make dist"
