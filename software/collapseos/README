# Collapse OS

*Bootstrap post-collapse technology*

Collapse OS is a Forth operating system and a collection of tools and
documentation with a single purpose: preserve the ability to program micro-
controllers through civilizational collapse.

It it designed to:

1. Run on minimal and improvised machines.
2. Interface through improvised means (serial, keyboard, display).
3. Edit text files.
4. Compile assembler source files for a wide range of MCUs and CPUs.
5. Read and write from a wide range of storage devices.
6. Assemble itself and deploy to another machine.

Additionally, the goal of this project is to be as self-contained as possible.
With a copy of this project, a capable and creative person should be able to
manage to build and install Collapse OS without external resources (i.e.
internet) on a machine of her design, built from scavenged parts with low-tech
tools.

# Getting started

Documentation is in text files in `doc/`. Begin with `intro.txt`.

Collapse OS can run on any POSIX platform and builds easily.
See `cvm/README` for instructions.

# Organisation of this repository

* blk.fs: Collapse OS filesystem's content. See below.
* cvm: A C implementation of Collapse OS, allowing it to run natively on any
       POSIX platform.
* doc: Documentation. Begin with intro.txt.
* arch: collection of makefiles that assemble Collapse OS on different machines.
* tools: Tools for working with Collapse OS from "modern" environments. For
         example, tools for facilitating data upload to a Collapse OS machine
         through a serial port.
* emul: Tools for running Collapse OS in an emulated environment.
* extras: Forth code designed for running in Collapse OS but that are beyond the
          scope of its design goals. See extras/README.

# blk.fs

This file is a big text file containing the "real deal", that is, the contents
of Collapse OS' filesystem. That filesystem contains everything that a
post-collapse computer would manage, that is, all Forth and assembler source
code for the tools it needs to fulfill its goals.

The Collapse OS filesystem is a simple sequence of 1024 bytes blocks. That is
not very workable in the text editor of a modern system. `blk.fs` represents an
"unpacked" view of that block system. Each block (16 lines max per block, 64
chars max per line) begins with a marker indicating the block number of the
contents that follow.

Blocks must be in ascending order.

That file can be "packed" to a real blkfs with `/tools/blkpack`. A real blkfs
can be "unpacked" to its text file form with `/tools/blkunpack`.

# Version control

To allow a deeper understanding of the code, changes to Collapse OS' source
is kept under RCS. Unlike most uses of version control systems, the goal here
is not to be able to branch or to checkout specific revisions: tarballs
snapshots can be used for this.

The goal is to keep a record of changes and their rationale, in case someone
examining the code wonders about such things. To that end, only the "real deal"
is versioned, that is "blk.fs".

Other source files (CVM, emulators, tools) are considered accessory and are
not version-controlled.

RCS versioning begins at 2021-01-05. Previously, versioning was done through
Git. An archive of that git repository is available on Collapse OS' website.

# Emulation and dogfooding

Emulation used to be a central tool to developing new ports for Collapse OS.
On a POSIX platform, I would begin by creating an emulator for my target
machine, fool around, then when I thought I had something good, test on real
hardware for adjustments.

With the 6809 port, I wanted to take dogfooding more seriously and began
developing ports from Collapse OS itself on vintage machines. This allows me
to see opportunities for usability improvements and detect bugs much better than
when using a POSIX platform.

Because of that, the "emul" folder is no longer improved.

# Looking for the assembler version?

The Forth-based Collapse OS is the second incarnation of the concept. The first
one was entirely written in z80 assembly. If you're interested in that
incarnation, checkout the `z80asm` branch in the Git archive.
