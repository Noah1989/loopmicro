# Extras

This folder contains Forth code that do interesting stuff within Collapse OS but
that is beyond its specified goals. It's therefore not really part of it, but
it's included in its tarball as a showcase of what interesting stuff can be done
with it.

Documentation for those extras are within them, not in doc/.

# Usage

To run on a real machine, you'll have to add extras to your medium in a manual
fashion. To run in CVM, some work has been done for you. By default, extras are
included in the blkfs file (look at cvm/Makefile).

However, because it's not part of blk.fs, it's hard to know in what block ids
these blocks live (it's not part of the Master Index). To know that, you'll have
to take a look at the output of the "blkunpack" tool during "make blkfs". When
it re-adjust block IDs upon encountering a root "000" block, it spits its
starting block to stderr. That's where the extra starts.

Accompanying extras are often some kind of "example usage" file. For example,
there's "example6809.fs" as a companion to "emul6809.fs". You could type that
code by hand, or take advantage of piping with

./cvm/cos-serial < ./extras/example6809.fs

and run the example directly.
