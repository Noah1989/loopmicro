# SMS pad

There is a driver for getting (key?) input from a SMS pad at
B335.

It conveniently exposes an API to read the status of a SMS pad
on port A. Moreover, implement a mechanism to input arbitrary
characters from it. It goes as follow:

* Direction pad select characters. Up/Down move by one,
  Left/Right move by 5
* Start acts like Return
* A acts like Backspace
* B changes "character class": lowercase, uppercase, numbers,
  special chars. The space character is the first among special
  chars.
* C confirms letter selection

This module needs CELL! (see doc/grid.txt) to display selection
on screen during (key?).

# _status ( -- n )

Returns a status bitmask for port A. Bits, from MSB to LSB:
Start - A - C - B - Right - Left - Down - Up
Each bit is high when button is unpressed and low if button is
pressed. When no button is pressed, 0xff is returned.
This logic below is for the Genesis controller, which is modal.
TH is an output pin that switches the meaning of TL and TR. When
TH is high (unselected), TL = Button B and TR = Button C. When
TH is low (selected), TL = Button A and TR = Start. )
