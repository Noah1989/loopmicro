# Remote access to Collapse OS

If you interface to your machine through a serial communication
device and that you have a POSIX environment on the other side,
Collapse OS provides tools in /tools which can be very useful
to you.

Uploading data to Collapse OS' memory is a frequent need
and /tools/upload can help you there.

See details in the /tools folder directly.
