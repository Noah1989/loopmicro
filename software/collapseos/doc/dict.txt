# Dictionary

List of words defined in arch-specific boot code (for example,
B280 for Z80), Core words (B350) and Extra words (B150).

# Glossary

Stack notation: "<stack before> -- <stack after>". Rightmost is
top of stack (TOS). For example, in "a b -- c d", b is TOS
before, d is TOS after. "R:" means that the Return Stack is
modified.

Some words have a variable stack signature, most often in pair
with a flag. These are indicated with "?" to tell that the argu-
ment might not be there. For example, "-- n? f" means that "n"
might or might not be there.

Word references (wordref): When we say we have a "word
reference", it's a pointer to a word's *entry type field*. For
example, the address that "' DUP" puts on the stack is a
wordref, that is, a reference to the entry type field of the
word DUP. See impl.txt for details.

PF: Parameter field. The area following the entry type field of
a word. For example, "' H@ 1+" points to the PF of the word H@.

Words between "()" are "support words" that aren't really meant
to be used directly, but as part of another word.

"*I*" in description indicates an IMMEDIATE word.
"*F*" in description indicates an word that sets Flags.

# Symbols

Throughout words, different symbols are used in different
contexts, but we try to been consistent in their use. Here's
their definitions:

! - Store
@ - Fetch
$ - Initialize
^ - Arguments in their opposite order
< - Input
> - 1. Pointer in a buffer 2. Opposite of "<".
( - Lower boundary
) - Upper boundary
' - Address of
* - Word indirection (pointer to word)
? - Is it ...?

Placement of those symbols is important. To the left of the
words, it refers to inputs and to the right, the output.

# Values and aliases

Values and aliases (see usage.txt) can be handled with those
words:

TO x     n --         Write n to value or alias x.
[TO] x   n --         *I*. Same as TO.
*TO x    n --         Write n to ivalue or ialias x.
[*TO] x  n --         *I*. Same as *TO.
VAL!     n a --       Write n to value or alias a.
*VAL!    n a --       Write n to ivalue or ialias a.

Collapse OS' core has a few *indirect* values and aliases which
can be manipulated with *TO, [*TO] and *VAL!.

Values:

BLK>     Currently selected Block.
CURRENT  Address of the last word of the dictionary.
HERE     Addr of next available space in dict
IN(      Beginning of the input buffer.
IN>      Current pos in input buffer.
NL       1 or 2 chars to spit during NL>, MSB first. If MSB is
         0, it's ignored.

Aliases (see further below for description):

BLK@*
BLK!*
C<
EMIT
KEY?

# Entry management

'? x     -- a f   Find x it in dict. If found, f=1 and
                  a = wordref. If not found, f=0 and
                  a = string addr.
' x      -- a     Push addr of word x to a. If not found,
                  aborts.
['] x    --       *I* Like "'", but spits the addr as a number
                  literal. If not found, aborts.
FIND     w -- a f Like '?, but for w.
FORGET   x --     Rewind the dictionary (both CURRENT and HERE)
                  up to x's previous entry.             

# Defining words

: x ... ;   --     Define a new word
ALIAS x     a --   Define a new alias with a starting value of a
*ALIAS x    a --   Define a new ialias where the indirection
                   points to a (actual alias in *a).
CREATE x    --     Create cell named x. Doesn't allocate a PF.
[COMPILE] x --     *I* Compile word x and write it to HERE.
                   IMMEDIATE words are *not* executed.
COMPILE x   --     *I* Meta compiles: write wordrefs that will
                   compile x when executed.
VALUE x  n --      Creates cell x that when called pushes its
                   value.
CONSTS x    n --   Create a serie of x constants. See usage.txt
DOES>       --     See primer.txt
IMMEDIATE   --     Flag the latest defined word as immediate.
LITN        n --   Write number n as a literal.
VARIABLE c  --     Creates cell x with 2 bytes allocation.

# Flow

Note that flow words can only be used in definitions. In the
INTERPRET loop, they don't have the desired effect because each
word from the input stream is executed immediately. In this
context, branching doesn't work.

f IF A ELSE B THEN: if f is true, execute A, if false, execute
B. ELSE is optional.
[IF] .. [THEN]: Meta-IF. Works outside definitions. No [ELSE].
BEGIN .. f UNTIL: if f is false, branch to BEGIN.
BEGIN .. AGAIN: Always branch to BEGIN.
x y DO .. LOOP: LOOP increments y. if y != x, branch to DO.

x CASE y OF A ENDOF z OF B ENDOF C ENDCASE: If x == y, execute
A, if x == z, execute B. Otherwise, execute C. x is dropped
in case of an OF match, *but it is kept if it reaches C*. You
have to consume it to avoid PSP leak.           

(         --   *I* Comment. Ignore input until ")" is read.
\         --   *I* Line comment. Ignore input until EOL.
[         --   *I* Begin interpretative mode. In a definition,
               execute words instead of compiling them.
]         --   End interpretative mode.
ABORT     --   Resets PS and RS and returns to interpreter.
ABORT" x" --   *I* Compiles a ." followed by a ABORT.
EXECUTE   a -- Execute wordref at addr a
ESCAPE!   --   Pop its way through RS until it finds a
               reference next to a INTERPRET call, then continue
               from there. In other words, escape current
               INTERPRET loop.
INTERPRET --   Main interpret loop.
LEAVE     --   In a DO..LOOP, exit at the next LOOP call.
QUIT      --   Reset RS, return to interpreter prompt.

# Strings

Strings in Collapse OS begin with a one byte length, followed
by the contents of the string.

LIT" x" --         Read following characters and write to HERE
                   as a string literal.
W" x"   --         Feed x literal to the next WORD-reading word.
SRANGE  s -- ah al Returns a memory range for string s.
S=      a1 a2 -- f Returns whether string a1 == a2.

# I/O

.        n --     Print n in its decimal form
.x       n --     Print n's LSB in hex form. Always 2
                  characters.
.X       n --     Print n in hex form. Always 4 characters.
                  Numbers are never considered negative.
                  "-1 .X" --> ffff
," xxx" --        Write xxx to HERE
." xxx" --        *I* Compiles string literal xxx followed by a
                  call to STYPE.
C<      -- c      Read one char from buffered input.
EMIT    c --      Spit char c to output stream
IN)     -- a      End of the input buffer, exclusive.
IN$     --        Flush input buffer
KEY?    -- c? f   Polls the keyboard for a key. If a key is
                  pressed, f is true and c is the char. Other-
                  wise, f is false and c is *not* on the stack.
KEY     -- c      Get char c from direct input.
KEY>    c --      Put back c for next KEY call to pick up.
NL>     --        Emit newline
PARSE    s -- n   Parses string s as a number and push the
                  result in n. If s can't be parsed, "word not
                  found" error occurs.
PC!     c a --    Spit c to port a
PC@     a -- c    Fetch c from port a
SPC>    --        Emit space character
STYPE    s --     EMIT all chars of string s.
WORD    -- a      Read one word from buffered input and push its
                  addr. That word is a string (begins with a
                  length byte).

These ASCII consts are defined:
EOT BS CR LF SPC

KEY? and EMIT are ialiases to (key?) and (emit) (see TTY proto-
col in protocol.txt). KEY is a loop over KEY?.

NL> spits CRLF by default, but can be configured to spit an 
alternate newline char. See impl.txt.

# BLK subsystem (see doc/blk.txt)

                 idates current block cache.
LIST   n --      Prints the contents of the block n on screen
                 in the form of 16 lines of 64 columns.
LOAD   n --      Interprets Forth code from block n
LOAD+  n --      Relative load. Loads active block + n.
LOADR  n1 n2 --  Load block range between n1 and n2, inclusive.
LOADR+ n1 n2 --  Relative ranged load.
WIPE   --        Empties current block

CRC16   c b -- c Computes byte b into c, a 16-bit CRC with a
                 $1021 polynomial (XMODEM CRC).
DUMP    n a --   Prints n bytes at addr a in a hexdump format.
                 Prints in chunks of 8 bytes. Doesn't do partial
                 lines. Output is designed to fit in 32 columns.
NOOP    --       Do nothing.
TICKS   n --     Wait for approximately 0.1 millisecond. Don't
                 use with n=0.

# Kernel internals

Some words from the kernel are designed to be internal but
ended up being used in "userland". Let's document them:

_bchk   n -- n     Checks whether n is a valid 8-bit signed
                   branching offset, that is, in the range -128
                   to 127. If not, abort with "br ovfl".
