# Dictionary

List of words defined in arch-specific boot code (for example,
B280 for Z80), Core words (B350) and Extra words (B150).

# Glossary

Stack notation: "<stack before> -- <stack after>". Rightmost is
top of stack (TOS). For example, in "a b -- c d", b is TOS
before, d is TOS after. "R:" means that the Return Stack is
modified.

Some words have a variable stack signature, most often in pair
with a flag. These are indicated with "?" to tell that the argu-
ment might not be there. For example, "-- n? f" means that "n"
might or might not be there.

Word references (wordref): When we say we have a "word
reference", it's a pointer to a word's *entry type field*. For
example, the address that "' DUP" puts on the stack is a
wordref, that is, a reference to the entry type field of the
word DUP. See impl.txt for details.

PF: Parameter field. The area following the entry type field of
a word. For example, "' H@ 1+" points to the PF of the word H@.

Words between "()" are "support words" that aren't really meant
to be used directly, but as part of another word.

"*I*" in description indicates an IMMEDIATE word.
"*F*" in description indicates an word that sets Flags.

# Symbols

Throughout words, different symbols are used in different
contexts, but we try to been consistent in their use. Here's
their definitions:

! - Store
@ - Fetch
$ - Initialize
^ - Arguments in their opposite order
< - Input
> - 1. Pointer in a buffer 2. Opposite of "<".
( - Lower boundary
) - Upper boundary
' - Address of
* - Word indirection (pointer to word)
? - Is it ...?

# Entry management

'? x     -- a f   Find x it in dict. If found, f=1 and
                  a = wordref. If not found, f=0 and
                  a = string addr.
' x      -- a     Push addr of word x to a. If not found,
                  aborts.
['] x    --       *I* Like "'", but spits the addr as a number
                  literal. If not found, aborts.
FIND     w -- a f Like '?, but for w.
EMPTY    --       Rewind HERE and CURRENT where they were at
                  system initialization.            
FORGET   x --     Rewind the dictionary (both CURRENT and HERE)
                  up to x's previous entry.             
PREV     a -- a   Return a wordref's previous entry.
WORD(    a -- a   Get wordref's beginning addr.

# Defining words

: x ... ;   --     Define a new word
:* x        a --   Define a new alias
:** x       a --   Define a new ialias
CREATE x    --     Create cell named x. Doesn't allocate a PF.
[COMPILE] x --     *I* Compile word x and write it to HERE.
                   IMMEDIATE words are *not* executed.
COMPILE x   --     *I* Meta compiles: write wordrefs that will
                   compile x when executed.
CONSTANT x  n --   Creates cell x that when called pushes its
                   value.
DOES>       --     See primer.txt
IMMEDIATE   --     Flag the latest defined word as immediate.
LITN        n --   Write number n as a literal.
VARIABLE c  --     Creates cell x with 2 bytes allocation.

# Flow

Note that flow words can only be used in definitions. In the
INTERPRET loop, they don't have the desired effect because each
word from the input stream is executed immediately. In this
context, branching doesn't work.

f IF A ELSE B THEN: if f is true, execute A, if false, execute
B. ELSE is optional.
[IF] .. [THEN]: Meta-IF. Works outside definitions. No [ELSE].
BEGIN .. f UNTIL: if f is false, branch to BEGIN.
BEGIN .. AGAIN: Always branch to BEGIN.
x y DO .. LOOP: LOOP increments y. if y != x, branch to DO.

x CASE y OF A ENDOF z OF B ENDOF C ENDCASE: If x == y, execute
A, if x == z, execute B. Otherwise, execute C. x is dropped
in case of an OF match, *but it is kept if it reaches C*. You
have to consume it to avoid PSP leak.           

(         --   *I* Comment. Ignore input until ")" is read.
[         --   *I* Begin interpretative mode. In a definition,
               execute words instead of compiling them.
]         --   End interpretative mode.
ABORT     --   Resets PS and RS and returns to interpreter.
ABORT" x" --   *I* Compiles a ." followed by a ABORT.
ERR       a -- Prints a and ABORT. Defined early and used by
               drivers.
EXECUTE   a -- Execute wordref at addr a
INTERPRET --   Main interpret loop.
LEAVE     --   In a DO..LOOP, exit at the next LOOP call.
QUIT      --   Return to interpreter prompt immediately.

# Strings

Strings in Collapse OS begin with a one byte length, followed
by the contents of the string.

LIT" x" --         Read following characters and write to HERE
                   as a string literal.
W" x"   --         Feed x literal to the next WORD-reading word.
S=      a1 a2 -- f Returns whether string a1 == a2.

# I/O

(parse)  a -- n   Parses string at a as a number and push the
                  result in n as well as whether parsing was a
                  success in f (false = failure, true =
                  success)
STYPE    a --     EMIT all chars of string at at addr a.
.        n --     Print n in its decimal form
.x       n --     Print n's LSB in hex form. Always 2
                  characters.
.X       n --     Print n in hex form. Always 4 characters.
                  Numbers are never considered negative.
                  "-1 .X" --> ffff
," xxx" --        Write xxx to HERE
." xxx" --        *I* Compiles string literal xxx followed by a
                  call to STYPE.
C<      -- c      Read one char from buffered input.
EMIT    c --      Spit char c to output stream
IN>     -- a      Address of variable containing current pos in
                  input buffer.
IN$     --        Flush input buffer
KEY?    -- c? f   Polls the keyboard for a key. If a key is
                  pressed, f is true and c is the char. Other-
                  wise, f is false and c is *not* on the stack.
KEY     -- c      Get char c from direct input.
KEY>    c --      Put back c for next KEY call to pick up.
NL>     --        Emit newline
PC!     c a --    Spit c to port a
PC@     a -- c    Fetch c from port a
RDLN    --        Read a line in IN(
SPC>    --        Emit space character
WORD    -- a      Read one word from buffered input and push its
                  addr. Always null terminated. If ASCII EOT is
                  encountered, a will point to it (it is cons-
                  idered a word).

These ASCII consts are defined:
EOT BS CR LF SPC

KEY? and EMIT are ialiases to (key?) and (emit) (see TTY proto-
col in protocol.txt). KEY is a loop over KEY?.

NL> spits CRLF by default, but can be configured to spit an 
alternate newline char. See impl.txt.

# Disk

BLK>   -- a      Address of the current block variable.
BLK(   -- a      Beginning addr of blk buf.

                 in the form of 16 lines of 64 columns.

# Other

BIN+    n -- a   Returns binary start + n. This is what BIN( was

                 0x1021 polynomial (XMODEM CRC).
DUMP    n a --   Prints n bytes at addr a in a hexdump format.
                 Prints in chunks of 8 bytes. Doesn't do partial
                 lines. Output is designed to fit in 32 columns.
RAM+    n -- a   Return SYSVARS + n for current system.
TICKS   n --     Wait for approximately 0.1 millisecond. Don't
                 use with n=0.

# Kernel internals

Some words from the kernel are designed to be internal but
ended up being used in "userland". Let's document them:

_pdacc  r c -- r f Parse decimal digit c and accumulate into
                   result r. Flag f is true when c was a valid
                   digit.
_bchk   n -- n     Checks whether n is a valid 8-bit signed
                   branching offset, that is, in the range -128
                   to 127. If not, abort with "br ovfl".

# Cross-compilation

These words are only available through B200.

:_      --         Define a new anonymous word.
_       --         Call the last defined anonymous word.
