# Assembling binaries

Collapse OS features many assemblers. Each of them have their
specificities, but they are very similar in the way they work.

This page describes common behavior. Some assemblers stray from
it. Refer to arch-specific documentation for details.

# Initial setup

After you've loaded the assembler (for example, with "5 LOAD"
in the case of the Z80 assembler), you have to set it up before
spitting opcodes. More specifically, you might have to set
ORG and BIN( variables.

ORG, defaulting to 0, specifies where the binary begins in
memory. It allows the PC word to return the proper value.
Generally, when you're ready to spit upcodes, you run
"H@ ORG !" so that PC is set to 0.

BIN(, defaulting to 0, specifies where the resulting binary
lives in memory. If all you spit are relative jumps, it doesn't
matter, but if you need to jump to an absolute address, BIN(
needs to be correct. Note that ;CODE spits an absolute jump, so
BIN( very often needs to be correct.

# Live targets

If you want to assemble code that will run on the current env-
ironment (a "live" target), you need to set ORG and BIN( to the
"live" binary start (you can get this with "0 BIN+") and you
need to set the "lblnext" variable, which is the address of the
"next" routine which is jumped to at the end of every CODE
word. That address lives in the Stable ABI and can be obtained
with "0xf BIN+ @".

Assemblers supply a helper word to do all that: LIVETGT. Call
this whenever you want to assemble for a live target.

# Usage

To spit binary code, use opcode words such as "LDrr," in the
Z80 assembler which spits LD in its "r1, r2" form. Unlike
typical assemblers, operation arguments go before the opcode
word, not after it. Therefore, the "LD A, B" you would write in
a regular assembler becomes "A B LDrr,"

Those opcode words, of which there is a complete list in each
arch-specific documentation, end with "," to indicate that their
effect is to write (,) the corresponding opcode.

The "argtype" suffix after each mnemonic is needed because the
assembler doesn't auto-detect the op's form based on arguments.
It has to be explicitly specified.

Although efforts are made to keep those argtypes consistent
across arches, there are differences. Arch-specific doc has
precise definitions for those argtypes.

For example, in Z80 asm, "r" is for 8-bit registers, "d" for
16-bit ones, "i" for immediate, "c" is for conditions.

# Labels and flow

Labels are a convenient way of managing relative jump
calculations. Backward labels are easy. It is only a matter or
recording "HERE" and do subtractions. Forward labels record the
place where we should write the offset, and then when we get to
that point later on, the label records the offset there.

To avoid using dict memory in compilation targets, we
pre-declare label variables here, which means we have a limited
number of it. We have 4: L1, L2, L3, L4.

There are 2 label types: backward and forward. For each type,
there are two actions: set and write. Setting a label is
declaring where it is. Words for this are BSET and FSET. It has
to be performed at the label's destination. Writing a label is
writing its offset difference to the binary result. It has to be
done right after a relative jump operation. Word for this are
BWR and FWR. Yes, those words are only for relative jumps.

For backward labels, set happens before write. For forward
labels, write happen before set. The write operation writes a
dummy placeholder, and then the set operation writes the offset
at that placeholder's address.

Variable actions are expected to be called with labels in
front of them. Z80 examples:

L1 BSET NOP, JR, L1 BWR ( backward jump )
JR, L1 FWR NOP, L1 FSET ( forward jump )

Can you use labels with JP, and CALL,? Yes, but only backwards
jumps, and in that case, you use the label's value directly.
Example: L2 @ CALL,

# Structured flow

Collapse OS assemblers have words that behave similarly to
IF..THEN and BEGIN..UNTIL. Those words use forward and backward
jump mechanism desribed above, but use the parameter stack to
hold PC values instead of using label variables.

Unlike Forth's IF, the condition for the jump doesn't come from
PS, but comes from CPU flags. For example, in Z80, "IFZ," will
jump to "THEN," if Z is not set.

There can be an ELSE, in the middle of an IF, and THEN,. When
present, IF, jumps to it when the condition is unmet. When the
condition is met, upon reaching the ELSE, we unconditionally
jump to the THEN,.

On the BEGIN,..AGAIN, side, it's a bit different. You start
with your BEGIN, instruction, and then later you issue a
jump instruction followed by AGAIN,. Exactly like you would do
with a label. Z80 examples:

IFZ, NOP, ELSE, NOP, THEN,
BEGIN, NOP, JR, AGAIN, ( unconditional )
BEGIN, NOP, JRZ, AGAIN, ( conditional )

# Endian-ness

As explained in cross.txt, all assembler supply words allowing
to write 16bit numbers in a target's endian-ness. Common words
at B2 already supply these words and they're all dependent on
the BIGEND? variable which defaults to 0. Assemblers for big-
endian architectures have to set this to 1.
