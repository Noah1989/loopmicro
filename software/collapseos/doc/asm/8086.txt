# 8086 assembler specificities

Load with "20 LOAD".

# Argtypes

Mnemonics are followed by argument types. For example, MOVri,
moves 8-bit immediate to 8-bit register.

'r' = 8-bit register           'x' = 16-bit register
'i' = 8-bit immediate          'I' = 16-bit immediate
's' = SREG register

Mnemonics that only have one signature (for example INT,) don't
have operands letters.

For jumps, it's special. 's' is SHORT, 'n' is NEAR, 'f' is FAR.

# Mod/rm mnemonics

Mnemonics with "[]" argtypes are "mod/rm" mnemonics are are
designed to be fed with a "modrm argument". For example, if we
want to INC the byte in memory where DI points to, we would
write "[DI] [b] INC[]," If we want to increase the word at DI+1,
it would be "[DI] 1 [w]+ INC[],". List of modrm arguments:

[b]    Indirect byte
[w]    Indirect word
[b]+   Indirect byte + displacement (8b)
[w]+   Indirect word + displacement (8b)
r[]    Indirect byte to 8b register
x[]    Indirect word to 16b register
[]r    8-bit register to indirect byte
[]x    16-bit register to indirect word
r[]+   Indirect byte + displacement (8b) to 8b register
x[]+   Indirect word + displacement (8b) to 16b register
[]+r   8b register to indirect byte + displacement (8b)
[]+w   16b register to indirect word + displacement (8b)

NOT ALL COMBINATIONS ARE LEGAL. The assembler will happily
assemble mod/rm for instructions that don't support it. Only use
mod/rm arguments with instructions that support them.

The instructions list below specify available mod/rm forms for
each mnemonic.
