# Z80 assembler specificities

Load with "Z80A".

Mnemonics having only a single form, such as PUSH and POP,
don't have argtype suffixes.

Be aware that "SP" and "AF" refer to the same value: some 16-
bit ops can affect SP, others, AF. If you use the wrong argu-
ment on the wrong op, you will affect the wrong register.

If you look at the code for flow-related words, you'll notice a
mysterious "1-". z80 relative jumps receives "e-2", that is, the
offset that *counts the 2 bytes of the jump itself*. Because we
set the label *after* the jump OP1 itself, that's 1 byte that is
taken care of. We still need to adjust by another byte before
writing the offset.

Flow examples:

IFZ, NOP, ELSE, NOP, THEN,
BEGIN, NOP, JR, AGAIN, ( unconditional )
BEGIN, NOP, JRZ, AGAIN, ( conditional )
BSET L1 NOP, JR, BWR L1 ( backward jump )
JR, FWR L1 NOP, FSET L1 ( forward jump )

# IX+, IY+

IX/IY instructions are a bit complicated.  As a general rule,
IX and IY are equivalent to spitting an extra $dd / $fd and
then spit the equivalent of HL or (HL).

In "HL" op types, IX and IY words can be used simply. Examples:

IX PUSH,
IY POP,
IX $1234 LDdi,
HL ADDIXd,

In "(HL)" op types, all IX/IY words contain displacements and
need to be used with IX+ and IY+ prefix words.

Examples:

0 IX+ E LDIXY, ( ld e, (ix+0) )
-2 IY+ INC(IXY+), ( inc (iy-2) )

# Instructions list

Letters in [] brackets indicate "argtype" variants. When the
bracket starts with ",", it means that a "plain" mnemonic is
available. For example, "RET," and "RETc," exist.
