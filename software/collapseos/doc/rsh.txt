# Remote Shell

You can control a remote system from Collapse OS using the
Remote Shell application at B150. All you need are words that
follow the EMIT and KEY? signatures. Serial lines drivers
provide those words.

To use the remote shell, first plug your words into RSH aliases:

' FOO> ' rsh> *! ' FOO<? ' rsh<? *!

FOO> being the "EMIT" word and "FOO<?" being the KEY? word.

Then, it's only a matter of running "rsh". This will repeatedly
poll rsh<? and emit whatever is coming from there and at the
same time, poll KEY? and push whatever key you type to rsh>.

You can stop the remote shell by typing CTRL+D (ASCII 4).

See hw/acia.txt for tips on configuring a serial line.

# Uploading data

With rsh> and rsh<? set up, you can also upload data to your
remote if it runs Collapse OS. Use the "rupload" word. It takes
a local address, a remote address and a byte count. For example,
"0x8000 0xa000 42" copies 42 bytes from the local machine's
0x8000 address and uploads it to the remote's 0xa000 address.

When you execute the word, it's doing to remotely (and tempo-
rarily) define helper words and that's going to result in some
gibberish on the screen. Then, it's going to start spitting "."
characters, one per byte uploaded. After that, it's going to
spit two checksum: one for the data received by the remote and
one for the data sent locally. If they match, you're all good.
