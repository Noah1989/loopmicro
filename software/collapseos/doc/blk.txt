# The BLK subsystem

Disk blocks are Collapse OS' main access to permanent storage.
The system is exceedingly simple: blocks are contiguous 
chunks of 1024 bytes each living on some permanent media such
as floppy disks or SD cards. They are mostly used for text,
either informational or source code, which is organized into
16 lines of 64 characters each.

Blocks are referred to by number, 0-indexed. They are read
through BLK@ and written through BLK!. When a block is read,
its 1024 bytes content is copied to an in-memory buffer
starting at BLK( and ending at BLK). Those read/write
operations are often implicit. For example, LIST calls BLK@.

When a word modifies the buffer, it sets the buffer as dirty
by calling BLK!!. BLK@ checks, before it reads its buffer,
whether the current buffer is dirty and implicitly calls BLK!
when it is.

The index of the block currently in memory is kept in BLK>.

Most blocks contain code. That code can be interpreted through
LOAD. LOAD operations cannot be nested, that is, you can't call
LOAD from a block or you can't call a word that calls LOAD from
a block. 

# Exploring blocks 

Blocks 0 and 1 in Collapse OS are text blocks describing the
whole contents in all blocks, organized in sections. Sections
are typically 5, 10 or 20 blocks in size.

The first line of each block is often a comment describing the
contents of the block. To take advantage of this, we have the
INDEX word which prints the first line of each block in a range.

So, for example, if you see in the master index that Collapse OS
core words spans from B210 to B229 and you want to quickly find
a word in it, you'd run "210 229 INDEX".

# LOADing applications

The first block of each section (a section often contains an
application) will typically contain loading instructions. You
can work your way around following these instructions, or you
can take the easy way: application loaders. The BLK subsystem
has convenience words for loading applications at B234.

For example, it has the "VE" word which loads VE. Therefore, on
a freshly booted system, if you want to run VE, simply type
"VE". IF VE isn't loaded yet, it will LOAD. If it is loaded, it
will run.

# How blocks are organized

Organization of contiguous blocks is an ongoing challenge and
Collapse OS' blocks are never as tidy as they should, but we
try to strive towards a few goals:

1. B0 and B1 are for a master index of blocks.
2. B2-B100 are for assemblers.
3. B100-B199 are for programs loaded at runtime.
4. B200-B280 are for arch-independent cross-compiled code, inc-
   luding xcomp tools.
5. The rest is for arch-specific code. Blocks are grouped by
   arch and follow this pattern: First, the "boot code", then
   the drivers for machines of this arch.
The BLK subsystem enables disk access and provides all disk-
related words (LOAD, LIST, FLUSH, etc.). See doc/usage.txt for
usage.

# Including the BLK subsystem in a kernel

Before assembling, this requires 3 words:

BLK_ADDR: where the 1024 bytes block buffer will live. The xcomp
          unit defines it as SYSVARS - 1024 by default.

(blk@) blkno dest --  Reads blkno into dest (almost always BLK(
                      is passed there).
(blk!) blkno dest --  Write contents of buffer at dest into
                      blkno.

Then, you can call BLKSUB in your xcomp unit.
