# Collapse OS usage guide

If you already know Forth, start here. Otherwise, read
primer.txt first.

We begin with a few oddities in Collapse OS compared to tradi-
tional forths, then cover higher level operations.

# Cell size and memory map

Cell size is hardcoded to 16-bit. Endian-ness is arch-dependent
and core words dealing with words will do the right thing.

Memory is filled by 4 main zones:

1. Boot binary: the binary that has to be present in memory at
   boot time. When it is, jump to the first address of this bin-
   ary to boot Collapse OS. This code is designed to be able to
   run from ROM: nothing is ever written there.
2. Work RAM: As much space as possible is given to this zone.
   This is where HERE begins.
3. SYSVARS: Hardcoded memory offsets where the core system
   stores its things. It's 0xa0 bytes in size. If drivers need
   more memory, it's bigger. See impl.txt for details.
4. PS+RS: Typically around 0x100 bytes in size, PSP starts at
   the top and RSP starts at the bottom and both stacks "grow"
   against each other. When they meet, it's a stack overflow.

Unless there are arch-related constraints, these zones are
placed in that order (boot binary at addr 0, PSP at 0xffff).

# Signed-ness

For simplicity purposes, numbers are generally considered
unsigned. For convenience, decimal parsing and formatting
support the "-" prefix, but under the hood, it's all unsigned.

This leads to some oddities. For example, "-1 0 <" is false.
To compare whether something is negative, use the "0<" word
which is the equivalent to "0x7fff >".

# Carry flag

It's really useful in some situations to be able to access the
Carry flag following an arithmetic operations, but is it useful
enough to add that information to the word signature? or to
duplicate every carry-related arithmetic word? no.

To that end, we have the CARRY? word, which is always a native
word. Every time a native word for which a carry flag is
relevant, that native word will store that flag in an arch-
specifica manner. There's a SYSVAR reserved for that, but not
all arches use it. For example, z80 stores it in its shadow AF
register for speed.

CARRY? returns 1 if the last operation carried, 0 if not. How-
ever, it has to be called immediately after the operation
because it will quickly be overwritten. because of that, the
CARRY? flag is unreliable when used directly on the prompt
because at least one carry-word will be called during the
parsing mechanism. Therefore, CARRY? has to be used in a com-
piled word.

Carry-enabled words are denoted with *C* in dict.txt.

# Branching

Branching in Collapse OS is limited to 8-bit. This represents
64 word references forward or backward. While this might seem
a bit tight at first, having this limit saves us a non-
negligible amount of resource usage.

The reasoning behind this intentional limit is that huge
branches are generally an indicator that a logic ought to be
simplified. So here's one more constraint for you to help you
towards simplicity.

# Interpreter and I/Os

The INTERPRET loop, the heart of Collapse OS, feeds itself
from the C< word, which yields a character every time it is
called. If no character is available to interpret, it blocks.

During normal operations, C< is simply a buffered layer over
KEY, which has the same behavior (but unbuffered). Before
yielding any character, the C< routine fetches a whole line
from KEY, puts it in a buffer, then yields the buffered line,
one character at a time.

KEY is blocking and feeds itself from KEY?, which is not: it
returns whether a key was pressed or not. Also, it's a little
white lie that KEY is unbuffered: it has a 1b "putback" buffer.
Calling KEY> puts a character in that buffer and the next time
KEY is called, if this buffer has something, it returns it.

Both C< and KEY? can be overridden by setting an alternate
routine at the proper RAM offset (see impl.txt). For example,
C< overrides are used during LOAD so that input comes from disk
blocks instead of keyboard.

KEY? overrides can be used to, for example, temporarily give
prompt control to a RS-232 device instead of the keyboard.

Interpreter output is unbuffered and only has EMIT. This
word can also be overriden, mostly as a companion to the
raison d'etre of your KEY? override.

# Aliases

A common pattern in Forth is to add an indirection layer with
a pointer word. For example, if you have a word "FOO" for
which you would like to add an indirection layer, you would
rename "FOO" to "_FOO", add a variable "FOO*" pointing to
"_FOO" and re-defining "FOO" as ": FOO FOO* @ EXECUTE".

This is all well and good, but it is resource intensive and
verbose, which make us want to avoid this pattern for words
that are often used.

For this purpose, Collapse OS has two special word types:
alias and ialiases (indirect alias).

An alias is a variable that contains a pointer to another word.
When invoked, we invoke the specified pointer with minimal over-
head. Using our FOO example above, we would create an alias
with "' _FOO :* FOO". Invoking FOO will then invoke "_FOO". You
can change the alias' pointer with "*!" like this:
"' BAR ' FOO *!". FOO now invokes BAR.

Aliases execution takes place in native code and is much, much
faster than the "@ EXECUTE" form.

A ialias is like an alias, but with a second level of indi-
rection. The variable points to a cell pointing to our word.
It works like an alias, except you have to use ":**" and "**!".
Ialiases are used by core code which point to hardcoded
addresses in RAM (because the core code is designed to run from
ROM, we can't have regular variables). You are unlikely to
need ialiases in regular code.

# Disk blocks

Disk blocks are Collapse OS' main access to permanent storage.
The system is exceedingly simple: blocks are contiguous 
chunks of 1024 bytes each living on some permanent media such
as floppy disks or SD cards. They are mostly used for text,
either informational or source code, which is organized into
16 lines of 64 characters each.

Blocks are referred to by number, 0-indexed. They are read
through BLK@ and written through BLK!. When a block is read,
its 1024 bytes content is copied to an in-memory buffer
starting at BLK( and ending at BLK). Those read/write
operations are often implicit. For example, LIST calls BLK@.

When a word modifies the buffer, it sets the buffer as dirty
by calling BLK!!. BLK@ checks, before it reads its buffer,
whether the current buffer is dirty and implicitly calls BLK!
when it is.

The index of the block currently in memory is kept in BLK>.

Most blocks contain code. That code can be interpreted through
LOAD. LOAD operations can be nested. Programs stored in blocks
frequently have "loader blocks" that take care of loading all
blocks relevant to the program.

# Spanning multiple disks

Blocks spanning multiple disks are tricky. If your media isn't
large enough to hold all Collapse OS blocks in one unit, you'll
have to make it span multiple disks. Block reference in
informational texts aren't a problem: When you swap your disk,
you mentally adjust the block number you fetch.

However, absolute LOAD operations in Collapse OS aren't aware
of disk spanning and will not work properly in your spanned
system.

Although the usage of absolute LOAD calls are minimally used
(relative LOADs are preferred), they are sometimes unavoidable.
When you span Collapse OS over multiple disks, don't forget to
adjust those absolute LOADs.

When you work with multiple disks, you have to remember to FLUSH
before swapping the disk. This will write current block if it's
dirty and also invalidate the cache. This way, you're not at
risk of either overwriting a block on your other disk or LOADing
cached contents without noticing.

# How blocks are organized

Organization of contiguous blocks is an ongoing challenge and
Collapse OS' blocks are never as tidy as they should, but we
try to strive towards a few goals:

1. B0 and B1 are for a master index of blocks.
2. B2-B100 are for assemblers.
3. B100-B199 are for programs loaded at runtime.
4. B200-B280 are for arch-independent cross-compiled code, inc-
   luding xcomp tools.
5. The rest is for arch-specific code. Blocks are grouped by
   arch and follow this pattern: First, the "boot code", then
   the drivers for machines of this arch.
