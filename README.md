# Loop Microcomputer
a minmal 8-bit machine that is...

- ... independent:
    - contains all the tools required to design another version of itself
    - does not require high soldering skills, uses through-hole parts only
    - uses only "evergreen" parts that have been in production for decades and are still made today

- ... aproachable:
    - simple through reduction
    - not "dumbed down" by hiding complexity behind brittle abstractions
    - open source and self-documenting

- ... powerful, with it you can:
    - learn/teach how computers work
    - design electronics
    - control CNC machines / 3d printers
    - play games
